# Python-Projects

Hello everybody, 

In this repository I will be showcasing some of my Python scripts. 
All scripts have been written using Python 3.

- Weather Scraper.

This is the first web scraper I have ever made. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape https://www.weather.gov/. The script was written to scrape the weather forecast for Chicago.

- Poe's Raven Scrape

This is another web scraper I made. This script scrapes the Project Gutenburg website and scrapes a random stanza from Edgar Alan Poe's poem The Raven.

- Giovanny's Pizzeria

This is a fun little script i made in order to solidify some of the Python concepts I have been learning. It is a program simulating a pizzeria which i appropriately named Giovanny's Pizzeria as the name just seemed so natural. It incorporates the use of lists, dictionaries, logical operators and loops.
