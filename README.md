# Python-Projects

Hello everybody, 

In this repository I will be showcasing some of my Python scripts. 
All scripts have been written using Python 3.

- Weather Scraper.

This is the first web scraper I have ever made. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape https://www.weather.gov/. The script was written to scrape the weather forecast for Chicago.

- Poe's Raven Scrape

This is another web scraper I made. This script scrapes the Project Gutenburg website and scrapes a random stanza from Edgar Alan Poe's poem The Raven.
