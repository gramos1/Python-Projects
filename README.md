# Python-Projects

Hello everybody, 

In this repository I will be showcasing some of my Python scripts. 
All scripts have been written using Python 3.

- Chicago Weather Scraper.

This is the first web scraper I have ever made. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape https://www.weather.gov/. The script was written to scrape the weather forecast for Chicago.

- Poe's Raven Scrape

This is another web scraper I made which also uses BeautifulSoup. This script scrapes the Project Gutenburg website and scrapes a random stanza from Edgar Alan Poe's poem The Raven.

- Giovanny's Pizzeria

This is a fun little script I made in order to solidify some of the Python concepts I have been learning. It is a program simulating a pizzeria which i appropriately named Giovanny's Pizzeria as the name just seemed so natural. It incorporates the use of lists, dictionaries, logical operators and loops.

- UPS CampuShip Tool

This is a script I made to assist me and some of my co-workers at my workplace. It automates the filling out of fields in the UPS CampusShip website, I made it using the Selenium library and Chrome webdriver. In order to use it you must install Selenium and download the Chrome Webdriver and place it inside 'C:/ChromeDriver/'.
